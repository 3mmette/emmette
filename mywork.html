                <!-- Why -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">This was my favorite project for many reasons.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                    <li>I am an enthusiast of games in all forms â€” board, video and sports. To create one was amazing.
                    </li>
                    <li>The project gave me the freedom to craft an entirely new world for others to discover.</li>
                    <li>It involved designing challenges for players and solving problems during development.</li>
                    <li>It was something I could not only show my friends, but watch them play and enjoy it.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing Python to program the game mechanics was both challenging and rewarding.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- Overview -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">The task was to write a simple, single player, vintage text-based
                    adventure game in Python3
                    using an Object Orientated Programming design. With ample free time and a genuine enthusiasm for
                    this
                    project, I perhaps expanded the scope a bit beyond the basic requirements.</p>
                <!-- Features -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">The game ultimately featured:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                    <li>11 explorable locations. (Initially required 10 and finalized at 5)</li>

                    <li>Dozens of interactive items. (Initially requried 10 and finalized at 5)</li>
                    <li>A limited bag to carry moveable items. (Added limit)</li>
                    <li>A map showing your current and discovered locations. (Upgraded)</li>
                    <li>An extensive help menu. (Added)</li>
                    <li>Multiple ending for winning and losing. (Added multiple)</li>

                <!-- Locations -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Explorable Locations</h3>
                <p>I initially designed the game world using a 3x3 grid, representing locations on an island. To meet
                    the
                    requirement of having 10 explorable locations, I introduced a boat in the lower-left corner.
                    Surrounding
                    these locations was an ocean, which entering into would result in a game over. Seeking to provide a
                    secondary avenue to completing the game, I expanded the map by adding a new location to the north.
                    Each
                    location was crafted with its own distinct description, items, and ambiance, all serving specific
                    roles
                    within the game's narrative.</p>

                <!-- Actions -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Various Action Words</h3>
                <p>Within the game, you have the option to perform these actions.</p>
                <p>The following can be used on their own:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                    <li>Help (H) - Opens an in game conversation if you require assistance.</li>
                    <li>Refresh (R) - Clears up the screen and displays the original location information again.</li>
                    <li>Bag (B) - Opens you bag, displaying capacity and carried items.</li>
                    <li>Chart (C) - Opens a map, showing your location and discovered locations.</li>
                    <li>Quit (Q) - Leave the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following require an item written in caps lock:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-12">
                    <li>Look (L) - Take a closer look to discover more information about the item</li>
                    <li>Move (M) - Use with a cardinal direct (N, S, E, W) to move to an adjacent location.</li>
                    <li>Interact (I) - When you wish to interact with an object or utilize an item from your inventory
                    </li>

                    <li>Take (T) - Place an item in your bag to take with you.</li>
                    <li>Drop (D) - Drop an item in your bag, it will remain in this location.</li>
                    <li>Speak (S) - Interact with an NPC.</li>

                Three NPCs scattered across the map can assist you in your escape from The Island, but remember,
                everything
                comes at a price unless you're charismatic, and that will only get you so far. Help them, and in turn,
                they
                can help you.

                    no

                    various locations will become known to you as you uncover them.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Help Menu</h3>
                <p>I created a comprehensive help menu for the game to assist players. It provides a basic overview of
                    the
                    gameplay essentials, the objective on how to win the game and detailed explanations of how each
                    action
                    word functions within the game.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_8.png" alt="Island Game Help Image">
                <!-- Win or Lose -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Winning and Losing</h3>
                <p>I contemplated various ways for players to complete the game. The most straightforward method would
                    be to
                    escaping by boat. To utilize the boat, players would need to fulfill certain prerequisites:
                    gathering
                    fuel, power, and a key. To enhance gameplay depth, I decided there would be two alternative methods
                    to
                    acquire each of these essentials. This design ensured that if one item was missed or made
                    inaccessible
                    due to player choices, another path to obtain it would still be available, maintaining the game's
                    playability.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_4.png" alt="Island Game Primary Win Image">
                <p>For the secondary avenue to completing the game, I incorporated a puzzle that an observant player may
                    be
                    able to solve, rewarding those who explore and observe meticulously.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_5.png" alt="Island Game Secondary Win Image">
                <p>There are also various ways to lose, from wandering into the ocean to solving problems
                    incorrectly, and not eating or drinking to being poisened by consuming the wrong thing.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_12.png" alt="Island Game Loss Image">
                <!-- Puzzles -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Puzzles</h3>
                <p>I develop some puzzles that would vary with each playthrough. I created two, the first involves a
                    note where one out of ten different cryptic puzzles would appear, and the second where a colour is
                    randomly selected from six options, influencing the values of food items.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_13.png" alt="Island Game Puzzles Image">
                <!-- Perks -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Specialization</h3>
                <p>To enhance the gameplay experience, I provided players with the choice of four perks to assist them
                    during their adventure on The Island.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_14.png" alt="Island Game Specialization Image">
                <!-- Consumables -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Consumables System</h3>
                <p>To enhance the gameplay experience even more, I introduced energy and hydration mechanics. This
                    compels
                    players to manage their resources more carefully as they explore The Island, preventing endless
                    wandering. Additionally, perks can offer advantages like extended travel capabilities or enhanced
                    knowledge about consumable items.</p>
