                <!-- Why -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">This was my favorite project as:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 md:pl-12">
                    <li>I am an enthusiast of games in all forms, including board, video and sports. To create one was
                        amazing.</li>
                    <li>The project gave me the freedom to craft an entirely new world for others to discover.</li>
                    <li>It involved designing puzzles for players and solving problems during development.</li>
                    <li>It was something I could not only show my friends, but watch them play and enjoy it.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing Python to program the game mechanics was both challenging and rewarding.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- Overview -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">The task was to write a simple, single player, vintage text-based
                    adventure game in Python3 using an Object Orientated Programming design. With ample free time and a
                    genuine enthusiasm for this project, I perhaps expanded the scope a bit beyond the basic
                    requirements.</p>
                <!-- Features -->
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">Final Requirements were:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 md:pl-12">

                    <li>Interactive items x 5</li>
                    <li>Actions to move and interact</li>
                    <li>A bag</li>
                    <li>A simple map</li>
                    <li>A way to win and lose</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pt-2 md:pt-3 lg:pt-4">The game ultimately featured:</p>

                <!-- Locations -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Explorable Locations</h3>
                <p>I initially designed the game world using a 3x3 grid, representing locations on an island. To meet
                    the initial requirement of having 10 explorable locations, which was later reduced to five, I
                    introduced a boat in the lower-left corner. Surrounding these locations was an ocean, which entering
                    into would result in a game over. Seeking to provide a secondary avenue to completing the game, I
                    expanded the map by adding a new location to the north. Each location was crafted with its own
                    distinct description, items, and ambiance, all serving specific roles within the game's narrative.
                </p>

                <!-- NPCs -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Non Player Characters</h3>
                The three required NPCs, the requirment later reduced to one, are scattered across the map and can
                assist the player in their escape from The Island. I didn't want to make it too easy though, so items
                may have to be discovered first or items traded to gain assistance. I also added a character
                specializations to make these interactions easier.

                <!-- Items -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Usable Items</h3>
                <p>I needed a way to denote items that action words could be used with. I decided they would be written
                    in caps lock for easy identification, although not all items can use all action words.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_items.png" alt="Island Game Items Image">
                <!-- Actions -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Various Action Words</h3>
                <p>The player can perform the following actions.</p>
                <p>These can be used on their own:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 md:pl-12">
                    <li>Help (H)<br>Opens in game help dialogue</li>
                    <li>Refresh (R)<br>Clears up the screen</li>

                    <li>Quit (Q)<br>Leave the game</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These require an item:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 md:pl-12">
                    <li>Look (L)<br>Discover more information about the item</li>
                    <li>Move (M)<br>Go to an adjacent location with N, S, E or W</li>
                    <li>Interact (I)<br>Use an item from the location or your bag</li>
                    <li>Open (O)<br>For closed, unlocked containers</li>
                    <li>Take (T)<br>Place an item in your bag to take with you</li>
                    <li>Drop (D)<br>Drop an item from your bag</li>
                    <li>Speak (S)<br>Interact with an NPC</li>
                    <li>Eat (E)<br>Eat or drink a valid item</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Bag -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Bag</h3>
                <p>Items need to be move and used, so can be taken and stored in a bag. I chose to give the player a
                    capacity of five items. They can also be dropped if no longer required and will remain in the
                    dropped location. I also added a character specializations which allows the player to carry 10
                    items.</p>

                    the names of various locations will become known to they uncover new location.</p>

                <!-- Win or Lose -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Winning and Losing</h3>
                <p>I contemplated various ways for players to complete the game. The most straightforward method would
                    be to escaping by boat. To utilize the boat, players would need to fulfill certain prerequisites:
                    gathering fuel, power, and a key. To enhance gameplay depth, I decided there would be two
                    alternative methods to acquire each of these essentials. This design ensured that if one item was
                    missed or made inaccessible due to player choices, another path to obtain it would still be
                    available, maintaining the game's playability.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_win_pri.png"
                    alt="Island Game Primary Win Image">
                <p>For the secondary avenue to completing the game, I incorporated a puzzle that an observant player may
                    be able to solve using the granite block in the northern most part of The Island. This rewards those
                    who explore and observe meticulously.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_win_alt.png"
                    alt="Island Game Secondary Win Image">
                <p>There are also various ways to lose, from wandering into the ocean to solving problems
                    incorrectly, and not eating or drinking to being poisened by consuming the wrong thing.</p>
                <img class="pt-1 md:pt-2 pb-2 md:pb-5" src="assets/img/island_lose.png" alt="Island Game Loss Image">
                <!-- Help -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Help Menu</h3>
                <p>I created a comprehensive help menu for the game to assist players. It provides a basic overview of
                    the gameplay essentials, the objective on how to win the game and detailed explanations of how each
                    action word functions within the game.</p>

                <!-- Puzzles -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Puzzles</h3>
                <p>I develop some puzzles that would vary with each playthrough. I created two, the first involves a
                    note where one of ten different cryptic puzzles would appear, and the second where a colour is
                    randomly selected from six options, influencing the values of food items.</p>

                <!-- Perks -->
                <h3 class="text-center text-lg md:text-xl pb-1">Specialization</h3>
                <p>To enhance the gameplay experience, I provided players with the choice of four perks to assist them
                    during their adventure on The Island. They could choose to carry more items, reduce the cost of
                    movement, assist when interacting with charecters, or see values on consumable items.</p>

                <p>To enhance the gameplay experience even more, I introduced energy and hydration mechanics. This
                    compels players to manage their resources more carefully as they explore The Island, preventing
                    endless wandering. I also added character specializations which allow the player to extended
                    their travel capabilities and another to enhance their knowledge about consumable items.</p>
