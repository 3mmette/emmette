            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">I grew up on a property just outside a small town in the South West region
                of Western
                Australia. After
                finishing school, I chose to pursue my passion for outdoor activities, fitness, and adventure
                instead of following a path in science and technology. This decision led me to join the Australian
                Defence Force, where I served in the infantry for over a decade. During my service, I had the
                opportunity to deploy with Mentoring Task Force 2 in Afghanistan where my primary role was a radio
                communications specialist, and Operation Okra in Iraq where my primary role was a trainer and
                interpreter for the Ranger Special Forces Battalion. I also underwent training in multiple countries,
                including Jordan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Throughout my career, I
                completed a range of specialist courses, such as Signals, Mortars, Combat First Aid, Basic Dari, and
                Advanced Arabic. I also undertook promotional courses, achieving Student of Merit in multiple, which
                enabled me to rise to the rank of Corporal and take on acting Sergeant roles. I thoroughly enjoyed my
                time in the military, however, the prolonged periods away from home prompted me to leave the military to
                seek a more stable lifestyle.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">After discharging from the military, I embarked on an adventure through
                North and South America. I spent over a week in Black Rock City, immersing myself in the playa of
                Burning Man. I also hitchhiked and camped along the Carretera Austral, an extensive 1,200 km journey
                through the breathtaking landscapes of Patagonia.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">During my travels, I came across an advertisement for my current position as
                a Special Operations Group Officer with the Department of Corrective Services. Intrigued by the
                opportunity, I cut my travels short and returned home to begin the selection process. I successfully
                passed the initial selection and the intensive selection course. This role has provided the perfect
                balance between tactical engagement and the ability to return home daily, offering a fulfilling
                transition from my military career to civilian life.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">When my partner and I decided to live and work abroad, we both resigned from
                our jobs and embarked on an exciting journey through Europe and North Africa before eventually settling
                in Canada for a year. Toward the end of our time there, I took a three-month road trip across the United
                States, exploring the diverse landscapes and cultures before returning to Australia and resuming my
                former job. Some of the most unforgettable experiences included visiting the ancient pyramids of Egypt,
                staying at the iconic Mont Saint-Michel castle on its tidal island in France, and hiking through the
                breathtaking slot canyons of Utah. These adventures not only broadened my horizons but also deepened my
                appreciation for history, architecture, and nature.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">During my free time, I enjoy challenging myself and pushing my limits. I am
                currently pursuing my Certificate IV in Information Technology to expand my skills and knowledge. I also
                have a passion for outdoor exploration, especially through long, multi-day hikes in remote and rugged
                environments. In addition to hiking, I have dabbled in various adventure sports, including solo
                skydiving, with over 70 jumps to my name. Most recently, I have taken up outdoor bouldering, which I
                find mentally and physically demanding, as it combines problem-solving with strength. I also have a deep
                interest in survival skills and tested them during a two-week solo wilderness experience in Canada.
                Armed with only a few basic supplies, I lived off the land and navigated the challenges of the wild,
                further developing my self-reliance and resilience.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">In addition to these, I am passionate about gardening and look
                forward to purchasing a house soon so I can grow my own fruits and vegetables and keep some bees and a
                few chickens. I also have a deep fascination with space, regularly following developments in rocketry.
                During my time in the United States, I had the opportunity to visit the Johnson, Kennedy, and Marshall
                Space Centres, and I have witnessed rocket launches from Starbase in Texas and Cape Canaveral in
                Florida. In addition to these interests, I prioritize staying fit and healthy by eating well and
                exercising several times a week. Whether it's hitting the gym, going for a run, heading out for a climb,
                doing a yoga class, or learning a new calisthenics move.</p>
            <p class="pb-1 md:pb-2 lg:pb-3">I am currently happy with my life and in my job and may pursue leadership or
                training opportunities as they arise. If a chance to follow another of my passions presents itself, I
                would be open to exploring that path as well. What I do know for certain is that the future is bright,
                and I am excited to embrace each new day, eager to learn and grow.</p>
